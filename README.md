# Absurd Programming language

Absurd, but not literally. Statically typed, interpreted programming language, built to kill (my) boredom. Why should you use Absurd? Because you like it, 
if you don't, create your own language.

## Installation

To install Absurd on Linux, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
curl -sSL https://static.ykk2b.xyz/install.sh | bash
```

version should be displayed if the installation was successful. You can verify that by running:

```sh
absurd -h
```

On Windows, you can install absurd by running the following commands in PowerShell:

```sh
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://static.ykk2b.xyz/install.sh -OutFile install.sh
bash install.sh
```

Support for MacOS will be available soon.
