# Absurd Programming language

Absurd is an interpreted, statically typed and high-level language, designed to be as powerful and fast as Rust, but higher-level and much easier to use.

## Installation

Absurd is only avaiable on Windows and Linux, and support for MacOS isn't planned in the near future.

### Linux

To install Absurd on your Linux machine, open the terminal and run the following code:

```sh
curl -sSL https://static.ykk2b.xyz/install.sh | bash
```

`Sudo` mode might be requested to install the neccessary binaries for the language.

### Windows

Run following command in PowerShell:

```sh
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://static.ykk2b.xyz/install.sh -OutFile install.sh
bash install.sh
```

If the installation was successful latest stable version should have been displayed. To verify the installation, run the version command:

```sh
absurd --version
```
